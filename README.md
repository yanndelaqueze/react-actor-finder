# REACT - Actor Finder

[This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)]

Fetching Data from TheMovieDataBase API (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), this App allows users to search for People (Actors, Writers, Directors) and display all their credits (as Cast members, or as Crew members in a production).
Users can also search for Movies and TV Shows to display their cast lists. 

This app includes an "autocomplete" feature to guide search for records.
